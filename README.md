This repository serves as a centralized collection of all my cybersecurity research, write-ups, analyses, and documented findings across multiple domains, including AI security, offensive security, web application security, vulnerability analysis, and emerging threats in agentic AI systems.

The goal of this repository is to create a structured, open resource that reflects my continuous learning journey, technical curiosity, and hands-on research in modern security challenges
